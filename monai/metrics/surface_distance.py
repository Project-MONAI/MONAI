    """
    Compute Surface Distance between two tensors. It can support both multi-classes and multi-labels tasks.
    It supports both symmetric and asymmetric surface distance calculation.
    Input `y_pred` is compared with ground truth `y`.
    `y_preds` is expected to have binarized predictions and `y` should be in one-hot format.
    You can use suitable transforms in ``monai.transforms.post`` first to achieve binarized values.
    `y_preds` and `y` can be a list of channel-first Tensor (CHW[D]) or a batch-first Tensor (BCHW[D]).

    Args:
        include_background: whether to skip distance computation on the first channel of
            the predicted output. Defaults to ``False``.
        symmetric: whether to calculate the symmetric average surface distance between
            `seg_pred` and `seg_gt`. Defaults to ``False``.
        distance_metric: : [``"euclidean"``, ``"chessboard"``, ``"taxicab"``]
            the metric used to compute surface distance. Defaults to ``"euclidean"``.

            ``"mean_channel"``, ``"sum_channel"``}, default to ``"mean"``. if "none", will not do reduction.
        get_not_nans: whether to return the `not_nans` count, if True, aggregate() returns (metric, not_nans).
            Here `not_nans` count the number of not nans for the metric, thus its shape equals to the shape of the metric.
