    Module that adds a FPN from on top of a set of feature maps. This is based on

    The feature maps are currently supposed to be in increasing depth
    order.

    The input to the model is expected to be an OrderedDict[Tensor], containing
    the feature maps on top of which the FPN will be added.

    Args:
        spatial_dims: 2D or 3D images
        in_channels_list: number of channels for each feature map that
            is passed to the module
        out_channels: number of channels of the FPN representation
        extra_blocks: if provided, extra operations will
            be performed. It is expected to take the fpn features, the original
            features and the names of the original features as input, and returns
            a new list of feature maps and their corresponding names

    Examples::

        >>> m = FeaturePyramidNetwork(2, [10, 20, 30], 5)
