class ROCAUC(IgniteMetric):  # type: ignore[valid-type, misc]  # due to optional_import
    """
    Computes Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC).
    accumulating predictions and the ground-truth during an epoch and applying `compute_roc_auc`.

    Args:
        average: {``"macro"``, ``"weighted"``, ``"micro"``, ``"none"``}
            Type of averaging performed if not binary classification. Defaults to ``"macro"``.

            - ``"macro"``: calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted mean.
                This does not take label imbalance into account.
            - ``"weighted"``: calculate metrics for each label, and find their average,
                weighted by support (the number of true instances for each label).
            - ``"micro"``: calculate metrics globally by considering each element of the label
                indicator matrix as a label.
            - ``"none"``: the scores for each class are returned.

        output_transform: callable to extract `y_pred` and `y` from `ignite.engine.state.output` then
            construct `(y_pred, y)` pair, where `y_pred` and `y` can be `batch-first` Tensors or
            lists of `channel-first` Tensors. the form of `(y_pred, y)` is required by the `update()`.
            `engine.state` and `output_transform` inherit from the ignite concept:
            https://pytorch.org/ignite/concepts.html#state, explanation and usage example are in the tutorial:
            https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/blob/master/modules/batch_output_transform.ipynb.

    Note:
        ROCAUC expects y to be comprised of 0's and 1's.
        y_pred must either be probability estimates or confidence values.
