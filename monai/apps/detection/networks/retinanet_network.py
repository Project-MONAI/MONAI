    The input to the returned feature_extractor is expected to be a list of tensors,

    one for each image. Different images can have different sizes.

        returned_layers: returned layers to extract feature maps. Each returned layer should be in the range [1,4].
            len(returned_layers)+1 will be the number of extracted feature maps.
            There is an extra maxpooling layer LastLevelMaxPool() appended.
        trainable_backbone_layers: number of trainable (not frozen) resnet layers starting from final block.
