        - This case tests calling the stain normalizer, after the
          _deconvolution_extract_conc function. This is because the normalized
          concentration returned for each pixel is the same as the reference
          maximum stain concentrations in the case that the image is uniformly
          filled, as in this test case. This is because the maximum concentration
          for each stain is the same as each pixel's concentration.
        - Thus, the normalized concentration matrix should be a (2, 6) matrix
          with the first row having all values of 1.9705, second row all 1.0308.
        - Taking the matrix product of the target stain matrix and the concentration
          matrix, then using the inverse Beer-Lambert transform to obtain the RGB
          image from the absorbance image, and finally converting to uint8,
          we get that the stain normalized image should be a matrix of
          dims (3, 2, 3), with all values 11.

        - This case also tests calling the stain normalizer, after the
          _deconvolution_extract_conc function returns the image concentration
          matrix.

          with the first row having all values of 1.9705, second row all 1.0308.
        - Taking the matrix product of the target default stain matrix and the concentration
          matrix, then using the inverse Beer-Lambert transform to obtain the RGB
          image from the absorbance image, and finally converting to uint8,

          [[0.70710677,0.18696113],[0,0],[0.70710677,0.98236734]], as validated for the
          ExtractHEStains class. Solving the linear least squares problem (since
          absorbance matrix = stain matrix * concentration matrix), we obtain the concentration
          matrix that should be [[-0.3101, 7.7508, 7.7508, 7.7508, 7.7508, 7.7508],

          Beer-Lambert transform to obtain the RGB image from the absorbance
