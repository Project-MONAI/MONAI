Project MONAI
=============


*Medical Open Network for AI*

MONAI is a `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_-based, `open-source <https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/blob/dev/LICENSE>`_ framework
for deep learning in healthcare imaging, part of the `PyTorch Ecosystem <https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/>`_.

Its ambitions are:

- developing a community of academic, industrial and clinical researchers collaborating on a common foundation;
- creating state-of-the-art, end-to-end training workflows for healthcare imaging;
- providing researchers with an optimized and standardized way to create and evaluate deep learning models.

Features
--------

- flexible pre-processing for multi-dimensional medical imaging data;
- compositional & portable APIs for ease of integration in existing workflows;
- domain-specific implementations for networks, losses, evaluation metrics and more;
- customizable design for varying user expertise;
- multi-GPU data parallelism support.

Model Zoo
---------

`The MONAI Model Zoo <https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo>`_ is a place for researchers and data scientists to share the latest and great models from the community.
Utilizing `the MONAI Bundle format <https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/bundle_intro.html>`_ makes it easy to `get started <https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/tree/main/model_zoo>`_ building workflows with MONAI.
